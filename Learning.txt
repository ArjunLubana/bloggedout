                                        DJANGO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- A python web framework
- It implements the MVC model in web programming
- Modal are everything that happens in backend i.e Database management, receiving and responding to requests.
- Views is everything visual that is rendered to the user
- Controller is what interfaces the view and the modal. when a user requests a page, the request is sent to the controller which in turn routes it to the modal
  The modal handles the request by fetching the view with a response.

ROUTING

- In django, routing takes place in two phases. The main router is your main app. 
    The app created when you run; 
        
        $django-admin startproject <projectName>

    This initialises a new project and create a django main app of your project.
    The main app handles all the main routes of your project

- The second part is routing the requests too your various apps in your project
    To make an app, run the command; 
        
        $ python manage.py startapp <appName>
    
    This is when you make all of your apps for rendering html

The urls.py handles all routing between apps
The views.py contains responses for various requests
The settings.py contains all your settings
The apps.py contains all your app and app name (This should be added to settings.py under installed apps)

TEMPLATES

- You can render HTML templates
- You can render HTML or create a base.html
- Use extends to inherit from base.html
- You create a template directory inside your blog app (Apps)
- Inside the templates dir, we created a folder named as your app.
- With the template ready, we add an apps configuration inside the settings.py
- Inside the views, from django shortcuts. Use the render function to render the 
  html file.
- The render function still returns a HTTP response.
- We can pass context into our render function.

TEMPLATE INHERINTANCE

- Making a base html with markup that is shared between all pages.
- Use Url tag to go to a directory.
- To load static, add a block on base html file to load static

URL MAPPING

- Django really simplifies url mapping.

- You can do url mapping in two way. 
    1. By creating your own urls.py to map your views to the main app
    2. By importing directly to the main app urls.py. NB: This only maps a single url hence reduces 

  For app with multiple views to map, use an independent urls.py file to map all urls.

DATABASES

- Databases are handled with models.py in django.
- Models are first defined in a models.py file as a class with its name as the name of the model you want for your database
- All attributes in the class are the data stored inside the model.
- Django keeps track of all models after registering the app to the settings.py
- Foreign Key: A table(model) using a foreign key depends on another table and data can only be created by that table with the primary key.
- The data with the primary key can instantiate data inside the foreign key table to avoid IntegrityError.
